## Time machine

Time machine should not allow the user to enter datetimes. The time travel should be triggered through the story and the user should work out to what time they have been transported.

Alternatively, the time machine only sends the player from the present day, to a specific point in the past. This adds to the puzzles, in that some rooms require the player to go use the time machine to go back and change something or take an object back to the present to go forward.

## Map updates

Player meets a scientist in the main building which explains more of the story.

Add a puzzle/cipher to solve.

## Meeting other people

The player should meet other people in the world. These people will give the player information or just objects they need. They will be more complex than the other objects.
The player can speak to each actor. When they do, the prompt should change to describe the conversation, i.e. who is speaking when.

## Game engine

It should be possible to take a closer look at objects in the room. Currently, the 'look' command only looks for items in your inventory.
