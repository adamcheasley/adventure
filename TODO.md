Time machine
------------

Time machine should not allow the user to enter datetimes. The time travel should be triggered through the story and the user should work out to what time they have been transported.

Alternatively, the time machine only sends the player from the present day, to a specific point in the past. This adds to the puzzles, in that some rooms require the player to go use the time machine to go back and change something or take an object back to the present to go forward.
